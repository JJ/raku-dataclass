# Dataclasses in Raku

Dataclasses have all the mechanisms that classes have (can be inherited, 
have accessors), but they don't have any method. Inspired by [Python 
dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html). With 
private instance variables, they will be effectively frozen.
